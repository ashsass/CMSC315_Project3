 * Description: Ask the user for a binary tree input. Display the tree and determine if it is a binary search tree or not. If it is a binary search tree and is balanced, then ask the user if they want to input more trees. If it is a binary search tree but not balanced, redisplay the balanced tree and report the height of both trees. If it is not a binary search tree, still redisplay the values but as a binary search tree and report the heights.
